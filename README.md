Denial of Service Attack Simulator:

A Denial of Service (DoS) attack aims to make a network service, system, or application unavailable to its intended 
users by overwhelming it with excessive requests or exploiting vulnerabilities. The goal is to disrupt the normal
functioning of the targeted system, rendering it inaccessible to legitimate users.

The DoS attack simulator sends a high volume of UDP or TCP packets to a specified target IP and port to overwhelm 
its resources, causing disruption or unavailability. It can use multiple threads to increase the intensity of the 
attack.
